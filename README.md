I created this website for an activity for PBMUKS Freshman Orientation Camp 2021. The escape room has an Avatar theme, and follows the camp storyline.

# Technologies Used
The web application was created using ReactJS. The components were styled using Sass.

Most of the components were created from scratch, exception is the crossword puzzle where I used a third party library. I could not find a good sudoku third party library so I created it from scratch.
